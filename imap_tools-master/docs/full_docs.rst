README.rst is the only documentation.
There is no full API reference docs.

I tried to describe the library API as much as possible in README.rst
If you are using some imap_tools entity, just look at its args at source code by your IDE:
doc strings are present, argument types annotated.

Docs are not so necessary here, and I have no much time.
Also, python has self documenting language syntax.
Maybe I will do doc site after 1.0.0 release.
